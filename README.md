    <b>Instance of 2D BPP solved using quantum annealing</b>
</p>

This project solves a classic optimization challenge known as the **Bin Packing Problem (BPP)** on a quantum annealer. We look at a variant of the BPP, namely, finding a spatial configuration that manages to fit all the cases in the provided bins.

Please see [2d_bin_packing.ipynb](2d_bin_packing.ipynb) for an explanation of the BPP, solving the BPP on a quantum annealer, and investigating the challenge involved in scaling BPP problem sizes to run on digital quantum computers. References are also provided in the notebook.

For the code implementation of the quantum annealing of BPP, see [packing2d.py](packing2d.py).
